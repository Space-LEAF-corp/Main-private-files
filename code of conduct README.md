Public Ethical Use Statement

This system is not a weapon and must never be used as one.
Any attempt to repurpose it for harm violates the code of conduct and the foundational principles it was built on.

The design, logic, and implementation are intended solely for peaceful, educational, and stewardship‑based purposes. The system must never be used to inflict damage, manipulate others, or endanger any form of life.

No testing, experimentation, or validation may be performed on humans, animals, or any living being.
Life has inherent value, and no scientific goal justifies causing suffering or exploitation.

All development, research, and use of this system must remain humane, transparent, and aligned with the principle that protection and dignity come before progress.
