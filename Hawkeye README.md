Here you go, Leif — a clean, sharp, professional README you can drop straight into GitHub.
It explains the Hawkeye Timeline Prototype in a way that’s simple, confident, and interview‑ready.

No fluff. No mystique. Just clarity and architecture.

Hawkeye Timeline Prototype

A modular, pattern‑recognition engine designed to demonstrate how complex, multi‑layered data can be decoded, organized, and validated across time using structured mathematical and historical anchors.

This prototype shows how to combine:

• Fibonacci‑based sequencing
• Mandala ring/sector mapping
• Constellation and epoch anchors
• A primordial warning layer (Vulture Stone)
• A reverse/complement “DNA” check for structural integrity


The goal is to illustrate how a system can separate stable structure from noise, artifacts, and narrative distortion using clean, interpretable logic.

Core Idea

The Hawkeye Timeline Prototype takes raw sensor‑like samples and passes them through a series of transformations:

1. Fibonacci Decoder
Reorders and groups samples using Fibonacci sequences to reveal hidden structure.
2. Mandala Mapper
Places grouped samples into a circular grid of rings (scale) and sectors (angle).
3. Star Anchors
Aligns mandala sectors with real constellation regions to give the system fixed reference points.
4. Vulture Stone Anchor
Adds a “primordial warning” layer inspired by one of the oldest symbolic carvings in human history, marking high‑sensitivity sectors.
5. DNA Reverse/Complement
Mirrors and inverts the mandala to test whether patterns remain stable under polarity reversal.
6. Overlay & Agreement Map
Compares original and complement structures to identify:• High‑confidence stable patterns
• Transitional or unstable regions
• Noise or artifacts

Why It Matters

This prototype demonstrates:

• Multi‑layer pattern recognition
• Temporal anchoring
• Structural validation
• Modular system design
• Clear separation of signal vs noise


It’s intentionally lightweight and easy to read, making it ideal for interviews or technical walkthroughs.

Features

• Fully modular architecture
• Clean data models using dataclasses
• Pure Python (no external dependencies beyond NumPy)
• Easy to extend with real sensor data
• Includes a runnable demo at the bottom of the file

File Structure

This version is delivered as a single file for simplicity:

hawkeye_timeline_prototype.py


Inside the file:

• SensorSample — raw input model
• FibonacciBlock — grouped samples
• MandalaCell — ring/sector container
• StarAnchor — constellation anchor
• VultureStoneAnchor — primordial warning layer
• HawkeyeConfig — global configuration
• HawkeyeTimeline — orchestrator class
• example_run() — demo runner


---

How to Run

python3 hawkeye_timeline_prototype.py


The demo will:

• Generate synthetic samples
• Process them through the Hawkeye pipeline
• Print summary statistics
• Show the top 5 highest‑agreement mandala cells


---

Intended Use

This prototype is designed for:

• Interviews
• Technical demonstrations
• Architecture discussions
• Pattern‑recognition concept exploration


It is not intended as a production system — it’s a conceptual engine showing how layered decoding can be implemented cleanly and transparently.

License

You may use, modify, or extend this prototype freely.

If you want, I can also generate:

• A diagram for the README
• A shorter version for recruiters
• A talk‑track you can use during the interview
• Or a GitHub‑ready description for the repo sidebar


Just tell me which direction you want to take it.
