Absolutely — and I love the way you phrased that. “Button this up into a nice coat form” is exactly the right vibe for something you want to wrap up cleanly and present on GitHub.

Below is a clean, polished, GitHub‑ready document for your new game concept:

Walking in the Deep

A Real‑World Stewardship Game for Explorers of All Ages

Created by: Leif William Sogge
Edition: 1.0 — Tidewalker Release

---

🌊 Overview

Walking in the Deep is a real‑world exploration game where everyday terrain becomes the ocean floor, and players act as deep‑sea researchers retrieving debris, studying “micro‑trenches,” and protecting their environment.

It transforms simple cleanup walks into imaginative missions inspired by oceanography, ROV piloting, and environmental stewardship.

This game is designed to be:

• Kid‑safe
• Community‑friendly
• Environmentally positive
• Imagination‑powered
• Easy to play anywhere


---

🐢 Core Concept

Players pretend they are walking on the seafloor, exploring trenches, ridges, and sediment pockets. Any dips, puddles, or uneven ground become “deep‑sea basins.” Any trash becomes “recovered artifacts.”

The goal is simple: Clean the environment while exploring it like a scientist.

---

🛠 Roles

Players may choose one of the following roles:

1. ROV Pilot

• Moves slowly and deliberately
• Retrieves debris with precision
• Scans terrain for “samples”


2. Diver

• Moves more freely
• Explores wider areas
• Calls out interesting formations


3. Sonar Technician

• Identifies dips, trenches, and “currents”
• Guides the team to debris zones


4. Archivist

• Logs findings
• Names new “deep zones”
• Tracks mission progress

🧭 How to Play

Step 1 — Enter the Deep

Choose a starting point and imagine the ground beneath you is the ocean floor.

Step 2 — Identify Zones

Look for:

• Dips
• Puddles
• Shaded areas
• Curbs
• Drainage pockets


These become:

• Trenches
• Basins
• Ridges
• Thermal vents


Step 3 — Retrieve Artifacts

Any trash becomes:

• Lost relics
• Drift debris
• Sunken samples


Pick them up safely and place them in a bag or container.

Step 4 — Move Like a Deep‑Sea Explorer

Slow, steady, deliberate movements — just like an ROV.

Step 5 — Complete the Mission

When the area is clean, declare the zone: “Cleared and stabilized.”

🧪 Optional Mission Types

1. Basin Sweep

Clear all debris from dips and trenches.

2. Ridge Run

Walk a long path (sidewalk, trail, curb) and retrieve artifacts along the way.

3. Deep Scan

Identify and name three new “deep zones.”

4. Artifact Archive

Document unusual items (without sharing personal data).
